# Exercise 2: Basic Data Visualization Class
# ------------------------------------------
# This script defines a minimal data visualization tool using matplotlib.
# The goal is to critique the design as a contributor to open-source libraries,
# and identify improvements that could bring it closer to the functionality and
# robustness of mature tools like Seaborn or Plotly.
